    <ul>
        <li>A database of useful resources that scrapes the web for useful resources based on one's needs and location</li>
        <li>A document translation service that allows the user to upload an English PDF file, such as a job application or federal document, and have it returned in their native language of choice</li>
    </ul>

<h2>How does the information database work?</h2>
    <p>The database has been entered via the system admin and is saved to a database for users to access through the database page.</p>
